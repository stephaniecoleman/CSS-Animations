PERFORMANCE MATTERS

When it comes to making great apps, PERFORMANCE is HUGE.

MEASURE performance by looking at animations and transitions.

ANIMATIONS ARE RENDERED BY THE BROWSER

There's a problem. Animations RENDERED in the CONTEXT of the BROWSER. 
Lots of RESPONSIBILITY. Many things happening in MAIN THREAD.
LAYOUT = calculating POSITION and SIZE of DOM elements
PAINTING = RENDERS actual PIXELS on the screen

--
OVERLOADING THE BROWSER

JAVASCRIPT/JQUERY runs on the browser's main thread.
MAIN THREAD is already so busy, if you use JS for animation, INCREASED CHANCE OF MISSING ANIMATION FRAMES.

GPU TO THE RESCUE

SOLUTION = A helpful tool!
takes care of HEAVY CALCULATIONS related to rendering graphics and video.

THE GPU IS GOOD AT...

HARDWARE ACCELERATION

So let's get the GPU doing what it's good at. 
A process called HARDWARE ACCELERATION.
Browser offloads heavy duty calculations to the GPU because it can work more EFFICIENTLY

--
CHEAP OPERATIONS

Remember a couple slides ago we said GPU is good at drawing, redrawing, and transforming -- here are CSS Properties that utilize those types of processes.
When you use these CSS properties, GPU can be called in to assist with rendering.
If you want to MAKE SURE hardware acceleration kicks in, you can hack a little and include 3D transform declaration set to 0 in your stylesheet.
